## Setup
In order for the neural network to be trained, the MNIST training data **_must_** be downloaded in CSV format [here](http://www.pjreddie.com/media/files/mnist_train.csv) and then be placed in the `/MNIST dataset` folder. It exceeds 100 MB, so it could not be uploaded to Github.

There is more information about the functioning of the neural network itself in the first cell in `My First Neural Network.ipynb`
## Disclaimer
This code is largely based on the work and examples from the book _Make Your Own Neural Network_ by Tariq Rashid from 2016.
